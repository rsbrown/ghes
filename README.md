SUMMARY

ghes -- the GitHub Enhancement Suite (inspired by RES, the Reddit Enhancement Suite)

ghes is a browser plugin for the Forge build system from Trigger.io

currently, it only provides one 'enhancement' to GitHub: if you're on a pull request page, it adds in a "<< | >>" nav element to allow you to navigate to the next and previous pull requests on the project. Useful for quickly churning through a bunch of pull requests in your notifications queue.
